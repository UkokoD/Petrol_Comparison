# INTRODUCTION

With the removal of subsidies in Nigeria, the majority of our productivity lies in the use of petroleum products both for commercial and personal use. The increment in the price of petrol also resulted in the price hike of so many services including transportation which is  essential in the day-to-day activity of any individual in the country, to say the least.
Hence, a comparison with other countries in the same continent and other continents was needed to see how other countries fare in relation to the price of petrol and their minimum wage. 26 countries from different continents were used as a case study to get a vast understanding of the topic.


# Key Questions
- Do producing countries have lower petrol prices?
- Does having oil in a country affect the minimum wage?
- What relationship does the petrol price have with the minimum wage?


# Findings & insights

# - Do producing countries have lower petrol prices?

Producing countries refer to countries that export crude oil. It can be deduced that producers have lower petrol prices, in countries like Venezuela, Russia, UAE, Iran, Nigeria, etc. while non-producers like France, Germany, Spain, the UK, etc  have higher prices.

The top 10 minimum wage was taken out of the 26 countries used as the case study, just 2 producing countries made the list which are Canada and the USA.
More of the non-producers made the list which are Germany, the UK, Ireland, France, etc,

# - What relationship does the petrol price have with the minimum wage?

As seen, the majority of the countries have a very high petrol price and low minimum wage. Countries like Argentina, China, Nigeria, Ethiopia, France, etc as compared to the UK, Spain, Germany, etc

# Findings

- There is an advantage of some sort when the country produces crude Oil as relates to their prices.
- Being a producer does not in any way affect the minimum wage 
- UAE does have a minimum wage

# Recommendations
The removal of the subsidy is not the problem in itself, but the manner it was implemented. Nigeria has a long way to go as our main problem is politically inclined, policies are made without thorough planning.  This in return has thrown the middle-class citizens to the poverty level thereby increasing the poverty ratio. 
My recommendations are:
- Proper planning 
- Increment of the minimum wage 
- Proper communication of policies enacted or to be enacted
- Subsidy removed should be put into substantial projects that will benefit all citizens of the country, thereby reducing the weight of cost on citizens
- A good playing ground for businesses to thrive so that policies like the removal of subsidies wouldnâ€™t affect their productivity.
